# Gene Expression Syncronicity Using OpenCV

Using computer vision techniques, this method attempts to identify the gene synchronicity in 
data the same way a human would. Computer vision can surpass humans in speed and consistency 
when classifying objects and identifying patterns. Using morphological processing and frequency-domain 
evaluation this method attempts to derive the patterns in large sets of gene expression data more 
effectively than current methods.
